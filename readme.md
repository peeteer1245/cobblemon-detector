# Cobblemon Detector

This is a Client-Side mod to get notified of desirable Pokemon near your player.

You will get a text-notification in your local chat plus a audible Notification.

You can change what Pokemon you want to get notified of by changing the config file in your minecraft folder `config/CobblemonDetector.json`.
Changes require a restart to apply.
The config-file will automatically be created when minecraft starts.

The Notification will appear even if that Pokemon is owned by another player or you.
This information is Server-Side only ðŸ˜¢ .


# Config Examples

This is the default config file. It will be recreated when the file is not present.
```json
{
  "broadcastAllLegendaries": true,
  "broadcastAllMythics": true,
